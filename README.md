Project Title: Living Comfy

Team Members: Cooper Timmerman and Elena Ingraham

Description: A project that analyzed political polarization across the contiguous United States, comparing voter trends and income tax data associated with all 40,000 US Zip Codes.

Question: Are wealthy regions of the United States more politically polarized?
Answer: After analyzing our results, we could not find evidence to support this theory. The correlation between political homogeny and income levels is little to none. 

Applications: 

a) Those looking for a region to relocate (based solely on the level of income they could expect) could easily interpret this map and review the most recent years that indicate areas of high income.

b) Collective outliers could be especially important in finding areas of interest for campaign managers and politicians alike. Reinvestigating the outliers in this data set would bring even more knowledge. 

c) This information could be applied to voting prediction models by analyzing which state hover in the middle and are likely to flip. This could be important for politicians as well as business owners. For example if a conservative state is becoming increasingly liberal, the owner of a Legal Marijuana  distributor could look to invest in the newly liberal state before the market is oversaturated.
